func createBook(c *gin.Context) {
	var newBook Book
	if error := c.BindJSON(&newBook); error != nil {
		return
	}
	books = append(books, newBook)
	c.IndentedJSON(http.StatusCreated, newBook)
}

this is the code.

Line by Line BreakDown:

1. ðŸ”¹ func createBook(c *gin.Context) {
This defines a function named createBook.

c *gin.Context is passed to the function automatically by Gin.

It contains the request info, response writer, etc.


2. ðŸ”¹ var newBook Book
This creates an empty variable of type Book.

It will be used to store the book data sent from the client in JSON format.


3. ðŸ”¹ if error := c.BindJSON(&newBook); error != nil { return }
c.BindJSON(&newBook) tries to read the JSON sent in the HTTP request body and puts it into newBook.

&newBook means we are passing the address of newBook, so the function can fill it.

If thereâ€™s a problem while parsing the JSON (e.g., bad format), error != nil becomes true.

If there's an error, it simply returns early, ending the function and not continuing further.

4. ðŸ”¹ books = append(books, newBook)
This adds the newBook into the existing list (slice) of books.

The append function adds the book to the end of the books slice.


5. ðŸ”¹ c.IndentedJSON(http.StatusCreated, newBook)
This sends a JSON response back to the client with:

HTTP status code 201 (which means Created).

The newBook as the response body in a readable (indented) JSON format.
