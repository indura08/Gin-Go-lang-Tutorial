Q: 

okay look at this code here : package main

func GetAllBooks(c *gin.Context) {
	c.IndentedJSON(http.StatusOK, books)
}

func main() {
	//1.setting up router which handles different routes , endpoints of our application
	router := gin.Default()
	router.GET("/getBooks", GetAllBooks)
	router.Run("localhost:8080")
}
 im super confused that literally everything , please explain everything in this code, i want specially that in Getallbooks i'm passing something called c i don't know what is it? i'm super confused how that parameters argument has been passed inside the GET function call, everything is super confusing to me please explain everything ?
 
 
 
A:

Totally understandable! 😄 When you first start using Gin (or any web framework), things can look like magic. But don't worry — I’ll break down this code step by step, super simply, like you're building your first web app from scratch.

Let’s walk through the whole code line-by-line and make sense of it:

🍕 First Line

This just says “Hey, this is the main package — the starting point of your Go app.”

The function named main() is where everything starts running.
