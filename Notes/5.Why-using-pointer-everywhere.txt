if err := c.BindJSON(&newBook); err != nil {

🔸 Why do we pass &newBook (a pointer) instead of just newBook?
Because:

The BindJSON() function needs to fill the struct with data.

If you passed just newBook (the value), a copy of the struct would be passed.

So any changes made by BindJSON() would only affect that copy, not the real one.

But if you pass &newBook, it gets a reference to the actual struct — so it can write directly into it.


🔹 What does BindJSON() do again?
---------------------------------------
It reads JSON data like this from the request:


{
  "id": "123",
  "title": "Golang 101",
  "author": "Eliana",
  "quantity": 10
}

Then it writes that data into the struct you give it.

But to write into something, it needs access to the original memory location — that’s why it needs a pointer.

🔸 Example:
Imagine you have this struct:

var newBook Book // empty for now

Now you want this:

newBook = Book{
  Id: "123",
  Title: "Go",
  Author: "Vivienne",
  Quantity: 1,
}

But you want Gin to do this for you, by reading the request body.
Gin can only do that if it can touch the real struct — that means: you must give it &newBook.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this code here:

func getBookById(id string) (*Book, error) {
	for i, b := range books {
		if b.Id == id {
			return &books[i], nil
		}
	}

	return nil, errors.New("Book not found")
}

Why return *Book, not Book?

✅ Because you want to return a pointer to the found book — not a copy.

If you returned just Book, the function would copy the Book struct and return the copy.

But we usually want the real one (maybe to modify it later, or just to save memory).

So:

Return type	Meaning
Book	Return a copy of the Book
*Book	Return a pointer (memory address) to the Book
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: so in asp.net or java for similar kind of similar kind of backend framework i return he book object, not a pointer or something similar in this gin case, why gin is different than that , is it because it does not use class-object oop concept?

A: 
You are spot on with your thinking!! 🧠🔥

Let's dig deep into this — very clearly:

📚 In ASP.NET / Java backend:

You work with classes.

When you return a Book, it is usually a reference type.

public Book GetBookById(string id)
{
    // Book is a class (reference type) by default
}

In C#, classes are always reference types.

Even if you write return book;, you're actually returning a reference under the hood (without needing to manually deal with pointers).

✅ In Java:

Same thing — classes are references by nature.

You never manually worry about memory addresses (pointers).
The language handles it automatically.


🥷 Now in Go (Golang):
Go does not have classes like Java / C#.

Go has structs (simple containers for data).

Structs are value types by default, not reference types.

This means:

If you return a struct, it makes a copy.

If you return a pointer to struct, you avoid copying, and work with the real one.

So in Go, if you want behavior like C#/Java (return the actual object, not a copy), you must manually use a pointer (*Book).

👉 Otherwise it will copy all the fields.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: how classes are reference types i'm confused

A:

🧠 In simple words:
In languages like C# and Java, classes are reference types by default.

👉 This means:

When you create an object from a class, the variable you create doesn’t actually store the object itself.

It stores a reference (memory address) to the object somewhere in the memory (usually on the Heap).

When you pass a class object to a method, or return it from a method:

You are passing/returning the reference, not a full copy of the object!

🎯 A Quick Example:
✅ In C#:

public class Book
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
}

void ChangeTitle(Book b)
{
    b.Title = "New Title"; 
}

Book myBook = new Book();
myBook.Title = "Old Title";

ChangeTitle(myBook);

Console.WriteLine(myBook.Title);  // Output: New Title ✅

What's happening:
==================

myBook holds a reference to a Book object.

When we pass myBook to ChangeTitle, we're passing the reference (memory address), not a new copy.

Inside ChangeTitle, when we change b.Title, we are modifying the original object.


❗ Now imagine if classes were value types:
=============================================

It would have copied the entire object.

Changing b.Title would have only affected the copy, and original myBook would stay the same.

(That happens with structs in C#!)


public struct Book
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
}

void ChangeTitle(Book b)
{
    b.Title = "New Title";
}

Book myBook = new Book();
myBook.Title = "Old Title";

ChangeTitle(myBook);

Console.WriteLine(myBook.Title);  // Output: Old Title ❗



Q: so that why if i do Console.Writeline(mybook) it gives output like ma9Xb2234?

A: 

Exactlyyyyyy! 🔥🎯
You caught it perfectly!
