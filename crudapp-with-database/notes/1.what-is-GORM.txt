🌟 What is GORM?
=================

GORM is a library in Go.

It helps you connect to a database and work with data easily.

GORM = Golang ORM (Object Relational Mapping).

In simple words:
GORM lets you use Go code to talk to the database, without writing boring SQL yourself!


🏗️ Without GORM vs With GORM:
=============================

Without GORM										With GORM
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You manually write SQL: "SELECT * FROM books WHERE id = 1"			You just say: db.First(&book, 1)
You manage database connections manually					GORM helps you manage it
You map SQL results manually to structs						GORM maps database rows into Go structs automatically


📦 GORM Handles:
----------------

Connecting to the database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc).

Inserting data (Create).

Reading data (Read).

Updating data (Update).

Deleting data (Delete).

(CRUD operations basically!)

Plus:

Migrations (creating tables automatically from structs)

Relationships (1-to-1, 1-to-many, many-to-many)

Soft Deletes (mark as deleted instead of actually deleting)

🏛️ Real life example:

Let's say you have a Book struct:

type Book struct {
    ID     uint
    Title  string
    Author string
}

With GORM, you can easily Create a book in database like this:

db.Create(&Book{Title: "Harry Potter", Author: "J.K. Rowling"})


🛠️ Bonus: How to install GORM?
=================================

go get -u gorm.io/gorm
go get -u gorm.io/driver/mysql
